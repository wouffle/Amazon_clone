![Main GIF](main.gif "Main")

This is a copy of the world famous e-commerce webiste i.e. ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/Amazon-black?style=flat-square&logo=amazon&logoColor=yellow) Just tried my ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61dbfb?style=flat-square&logo=React&logoColor=black) skills to make real world applications, hence the original is build with ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Angular-red?style=flat-square&logo=angular&logoColor=white)

## Key Points

- This is only the frontend and no backend used
- Not fully copied amazon as there are lots of stuff and it will takes several time
- Add to basket functionality
- Subtotal functionality
- No reloading (Power of React)
- Total Items in basket functionality
